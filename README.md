# Customer_Segmentation
Creating Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)

## Project Introduction
This project is based on real-life data provided to Udacity by their Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. 
The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. 
The **objective** of the project is to:

_identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of the company's products for a mailout campaign_ 

## Library Requirements

This project uses Python 3 and is completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE.
The following libraries are used in this project:

* NumPy
* pandas
* Sklearn / scikit-learn
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Walkthrough summary

The project is divided into three parts
1. Assess and cleaning the data in order to convert the data into a usable form
2. Feature Transformation i.e. scaling, dimentionality reduction (PCA)
3. Applying unsupervised learning techniques on the PCA-trasnformed components to 
* organize the general population into clusters
* use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
